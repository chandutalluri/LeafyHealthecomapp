# Deployment Network Connectivity Fix

## Issue Identified
Container is healthy internally (health check passes) but external traffic cannot reach the application through Coolify's reverse proxy.

## Root Cause
Coolify may not be properly routing external traffic to the container on port 8080, despite the health check working internally.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced Network Binding
- Added explicit logging for incoming requests
- Confirmed binding to 0.0.0.0:8080 for all network interfaces
- Added error handling for network issues

### 2. Startup Script
- Created start.sh for better environment variable handling
- Added debugging output for port and environment configuration

### 3. Coolify Configuration
- Created coolify-config.json with explicit port configuration
- Specified public port mapping for port 8080

## Next Steps for User

### Option 1: Check Coolify Port Configuration
1. In Coolify admin panel, go to your application
2. Check "Ports & Domains" section
3. Ensure port 8080 is mapped as public HTTP port
4. Redeploy if port mapping is missing

### Option 2: Try Alternative URL
Sometimes Coolify assigns different domain patterns:
- Try: `http://106.222.233.10:8080` (direct IP access)
- Check Coolify dashboard for the correct domain

### Option 3: Container Logs
1. In Coolify, check application logs
2. Look for "Gateway bound to 0.0.0.0:8080" message
3. Check if any incoming request logs appear when accessing the URL

### Option 4: Health Check Direct
Try accessing the health endpoint directly through Coolify's internal network to confirm routing.

The application is running correctly inside the container - the issue is with external traffic routing through Coolify's proxy system.
