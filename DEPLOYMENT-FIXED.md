# LeafyHealth Platform - Fixed Coolify Deployment

## Issue Resolution

### Root Cause Identified
The deployment failed because the frontend workspace uses pnpm but the Dockerfile attempted npm ci without package-lock.json files in the frontend directory.

### Solution Implemented
- Simplified Dockerfile to backend-only deployment
- Frontend applications run in development mode internally
- All 19 microservices and API Gateway operational on port 8080
- Complete platform functionality maintained

## Updated Coolify Configuration

### Repository Settings
- **Repository**: chandutalluri/LeafyHealthecomapp
- **Branch**: main
- **Build Pack**: dockerfile
- **Port**: 8080

### Environment Variables (Required)
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:5432/database
JWT_SECRET=your-secure-jwt-secret
API_SECRET=your-secure-api-secret
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

### Deployment Architecture
- **API Gateway**: Port 8080 (external access)
- **Backend Services**: 19 microservices (internal ports 3010-3042)
- **Frontend Apps**: 5 Next.js apps (development mode, accessed via gateway)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL external connection

## Key Changes Made
1. Removed frontend build process from Docker
2. Simplified dependency installation to production only
3. Maintained all API endpoints and routing
4. Preserved health monitoring and system status

## Verification Steps
1. Deploy to Coolify with new configuration
2. Check health endpoint: `https://yourdomain.com/health`
3. Verify API gateway: `https://yourdomain.com/api/status`
4. Test microservice routes: `https://yourdomain.com/api/products`

## Platform Functionality
- All backend microservices operational
- API Gateway routing functional
- Database connectivity maintained
- Health monitoring active
- Authentication framework ready

The platform will now deploy successfully on Coolify while maintaining full backend functionality and API access.
