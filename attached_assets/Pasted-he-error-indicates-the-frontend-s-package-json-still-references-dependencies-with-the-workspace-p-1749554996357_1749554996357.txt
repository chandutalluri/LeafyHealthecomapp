he error indicates the frontend's package.json still references dependencies with the "workspace:" protocol, which is not supported anymore. This happened after removing workspaces from Node 20/npm 10. To fix it, we need to either remove all "workspace:" references and replace them with relative file paths or version numbers, or simply use npm install -w with the workspace argument to maintain the hoisted environment. It seems the workspace protocol, often used for internal packages like ui-kit, wasn't fully removed. We need to confirm the "workspace:*" entries are replaced throughout.

Done
npm is now stopping on EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL → workspace:*.
That means at least one package.json that you install inside the container still contains a version string that starts with the “workspace:” protocol.
Because you are now inside a single-package context (cd frontend/apps/super-admin && npm install), npm treats that workspace:* reference as an external URL and fails.

Why it happens
java
Copy
Edit
npm install …          ← we are *inside* apps/super-admin
└─ package.json
   "dependencies": {
     "@leafyhealth/ui-kit":  "workspace:*",   ← ⚠ here
     "@leafyhealth/auth":    "workspace:*",
     …
   }
Outside the monorepo this protocol makes no sense, so npm throws
“Unsupported URL Type "workspace:"”.

Your earlier helper script removed the *dependency entries that pointed to other workspaces, but it did not rewrite every version string. So the keys were deleted, yet some still remain (or new ones were added in another app).

Two clean ways to fix it
Option A – Keep workspaces (simpler, recommended)	Option B – Strip workspace protocol
1. Build the whole repo at once (root level) so npm understands the workspace protocol.
2. Then npm run build -ws or npx turbo run build.
3. Stop doing per-app npm install in the Dockerfile.	1. Run a sed/JS script before per-app install that rewrites every version which starts with workspace: to a real version, *, or a relative path.
2. Example:
```bash
jq '(.dependencies // {})

Quick win: switch to Option A
Dockerfile (root of repo)

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
FROM node:20-alpine

WORKDIR /app

# copy root + workspace manifests *only*
COPY package*.json ./
COPY frontend/package.json frontend/
COPY frontend/apps/*/package.json frontend/apps/*/

# single install for the whole monorepo
RUN npm ci --workspaces --include-workspace-root && npm cache clean --force

# build every workspace that defines a build script
RUN npm run build --workspaces --if-present

# copy the rest of the source
COPY . .

EXPOSE 8080
CMD ["node", "complete-platform-starter.js"]
No more cd frontend/apps/... && npm install.

If you must stay with per-app builds (Option B)
Expand your build-fix-workspace-deps.js so it also replaces the version strings:

js
Copy
Edit
if (depVersion.startsWith('workspace:')) {
  pkgJson.dependencies[depName] = '*';
  updated = true;
}
Make sure that runs before every npm install.
