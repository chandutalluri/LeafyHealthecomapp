üîç Forensic Audit of complete-platform-starter.js for Coolify Deployment
This script is a comprehensive platform orchestrator for LeafyHealth, meant to:

Launch all frontend apps (5 total).

Manage 19 microservices.

Serve as an integrated API gateway on port 8080.

Handle requests to /api/*, /admin, /ecommerce, /shop, etc.

Handle health and status routes.

Proxy requests to frontend apps and services.

üß† What‚Äôs Not Working in Coolify?
The script fails silently in Docker on Coolify. Here's what's likely going wrong:

‚ùå 1. Microservices and Frontend Apps Are Not Being Spawned
Inside the method startAllMicroservices(), this is called:

js
Copy
Edit
await this.startFrontendApps();
But startFrontendApp(app) just logs:

js
Copy
Edit
console.log(`‚úÖ ${app.name} configured for port ${app.port}`);
üö´ It doesn‚Äôt actually launch any servers, dev or production.
There are no spawn() or exec() calls to actually start:

Next.js frontends (npm run start after build)

Microservice backends (node index.js or ts-node ... or npm run start)

‚úÖ What Needs to Be Fixed (in Detail)
üîß 1. Actually Spawn the Frontends in Production
Inside startFrontendApp(app), you need:

js
Copy
Edit
const path = require('path');

async startFrontendApp(app) {
  const fullPath = path.join(__dirname, app.path);
  const child = spawn('npm', ['run', 'start'], {
    cwd: fullPath,
    stdio: 'inherit',
    shell: true,
  });

  this.runningProcesses.push(child);

  child.on('exit', code => {
    console.log(`‚ùå ${app.name} exited with code ${code}`);
  });

  console.log(`üöÄ Started ${app.name} on port ${app.port}`);
}
‚ö†Ô∏è But for this to work, ensure that:

Each app is pre-built using npm run build before container runs.

Each app‚Äôs package.json contains a working "start" script.

üîß 2. Spawn All Microservices
Inside your services array, each microservice should also be started. Add this logic:

js
Copy
Edit
async startAllMicroservices() {
  await this.startFrontendApps();
  await this.startMicroservices();
}

async startMicroservices() {
  for (const service of this.services) {
    const servicePath = path.join(__dirname, 'services', service.name);
    const child = spawn('npm', ['run', 'start'], {
      cwd: servicePath,
      stdio: 'inherit',
      shell: true
    });

    this.runningProcesses.push(child);

    child.on('exit', code => {
      console.log(`‚ùå ${service.name} exited with code ${code}`);
    });

    console.log(`üöÄ Started microservice ${service.name} on port ${service.port}`);
    await this.delay(1000); // optional throttling
  }
}
üß± 3. Add Build Step to Dockerfile
In your Dockerfile before CMD, add:

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
RUN npm run build
Or if you're using Turbo monorepo:

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
RUN npx turbo run build
Only if it builds successfully outside.

‚öôÔ∏è 4. Dockerfile CMD is Okay But Silent Failures Possible
Current CMD is:

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
CMD ["node", "complete-platform-starter.js"]
‚úÖ Valid ‚Äî this matches your entrypoint file.
But inside Docker, if any spawn() fails silently, Coolify won't catch it.

To test locally:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -it leafyhealth-platform:latest bash
# then manually:
node complete-platform-starter.js
Check for crash logs.

üõ°Ô∏è 5. Use PORT=8080 and HEALTHCHECK Only If Gateway is Running
Your complete-platform-starter.js binds to 8080, so your Dockerfile should retain:

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
EXPOSE 8080
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=20s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:8080/health || exit 1
‚úÖ That‚Äôs good ‚Äî no need to change it.

‚úÖ TL;DR ‚Äî What You Must Change
In complete-platform-starter.js:
Add actual spawn() logic inside:

startFrontendApp(app)

startMicroservices()

Ensure all apps and services have:

npm install

npm run build

npm run start scripts working

In Dockerfile:
Before CMD, add:

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
RUN npx turbo run build  # or appropriate build command
Keep:

dockerfile
Copy
Edit
CMD ["node", "complete-platform-starter.js"]
