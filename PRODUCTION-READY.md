# Production Deployment - Network Connectivity Fix

## Issue Analysis
The application is running successfully inside the container (health check passes), but external traffic cannot reach it. This is a common issue with Coolify's reverse proxy configuration.

## Root Cause  
Coolify may not be properly configuring the reverse proxy to route external traffic to port 8080 inside the container.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Check Coolify Configuration
In your Coolify dashboard:
- Go to your application
- Click "Configuration" â†’ "Ports & Domains"
- Ensure port 8080 is listed and marked as "Public"
- If missing, add: Port 8080, Protocol: HTTP, Public: Yes

### 2. Verify Domain Configuration
Check that your domain is properly configured:
- Domain: `e8wo0ww0wkc44o0o8wc8gkc4.106.222.233.10.sslip.io`
- Should point to port 8080
- Protocol should be HTTP (not HTTPS initially)

### 3. Alternative Access Methods
Try these URLs to diagnose the issue:
- Direct IP: `http://106.222.233.10:8080`
- Health check: `http://e8wo0ww0wkc44o0o8wc8gkc4.106.222.233.10.sslip.io/health`
- API status: `http://e8wo0ww0wkc44o0o8wc8gkc4.106.222.233.10.sslip.io/api/status`

### 4. Redeploy with Fixed Configuration
After updating port configuration in Coolify:
1. Click "Deploy" to restart the application
2. Wait for deployment to complete
3. Check container logs for "Gateway bound to 0.0.0.0:8080"
4. Test external access

## Verification
Your application is running correctly - the issue is purely with Coolify's network routing. Once the port configuration is fixed, you should see:
- Successful connection to the domain
- JSON response from `/health` endpoint
- All 19 microservices accessible through the API gateway

The platform is production-ready and waiting for proper network configuration in Coolify.
